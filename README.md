This fork fixes some of the later BeatSaver API changes causing inability to  download songs in-game. See the releases on this fork for the updated binaries.

SteamVR's poor reliability and performance has caused me to lose interest in VR, hence I sold my hardware and no longer play Beat Saber. As such, this repository is archived and unmaintained.
